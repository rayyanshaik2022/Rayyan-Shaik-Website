### Description
A showcase-esque project designed to demonstrate an improved understanding of sockets and client/network relationships. This is not a complete game, but includes complete portions of one - a main menu screen, working (not much playable content) game, and a level editor. This project features complex gui components created from scratch, such as buttons and text boxes.


### Github Repository
The [Github repository can be found here](https://github.com/rayyanshaik2022/Simple-Dungeon/)   

### What were my goals with this project?
* Create polished and reusable gui features
* An efficient map editor
* Preloading images and image animations
* An efficient way to send data between server and client   
this was solved through a custom push/pull method
