      <description>Description My implementation of the boids flocking algorithm in pygame. It uses arrows - representative of birds - as enties that move around and account for each other&amp;rsquo;s positions. Some additional features that I implemented include an &amp;ldquo;infinite border&amp;rdquo; - meaning borders transport entities to opposite ends of the map. The entities also spawn with random hues (color), and when several enities converge into a group, their colors average out. When these groups disband, the entities slowly revert to their original color.</description>
