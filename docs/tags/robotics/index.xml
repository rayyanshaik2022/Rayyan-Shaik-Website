      <description>Description Lakerbotics-1649&amp;rsquo;s robot code, written in java. This code was created from base to suit our robot&amp;rsquo;s needs and the challenge&amp;rsquo;s (Infinite Recharge) demands. Months of testing and research was spent learning the libraries required, and the &amp;ldquo;final version&amp;rdquo; of the robot code was developed over nearly 2 months. I have written the majority of this code (under the Lakerbotics Github account), and the overall project was a group effort with 2 other team members.</description>
