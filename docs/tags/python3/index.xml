      <description>Description 2048 is a popular web game, in which the player shifts numbered tiles across a 4x4 grid to create the number 2048. This project showcases my python clone of the game itself, and AI that can beat it quite effectively, using Monte Carlo simulations. This project in particular uses python, however I created two versions (one in python, one in java) to compare runtime speeds.

      <description>Description This projects features a 3D Rendering Engine that I have written using Python3 and Pygame (simple 2D graphics drawing library). It allows for the manipulation of points in 3 dimensional space. It was designed with the future use of creating a simple 3D game, and the code is written so that it is easy to utilize and understand from a high level perspective.

      <description>Description This is a discord bot designed to provide easily accessible statistics for the game osu! - a rhythm game with a wide player base. This bot can be used on the messaging &amp;amp; gaming platform &amp;ldquo;discord&amp;rdquo;.
The bot utilizes a few APIs and intuitive web scraping to easily find and calculate generalized and specific statsitics for osu! players. There are several osu! discord bots provide these statistics, however, what makes this bot unique are some of its original commands - notably the o.</description>

      <description>Description A multi-purpose discord bot to be used on a private server with my friends. This bot provides basic security for our server with an easily customizable verification system. Important e-learnig and virtual learning commands that can reply with my school&amp;rsquo;s schedule and per class zoom links. The bot can also join voice channels and play different sound effects stored as .mp3 files.

      <description>Description A showcase-esque project designed to demonstrate an improved understanding of sockets and client/network relationships. This was created in pure python with no game engines (such as Unity), everything from buttons, to servers, to the physics was created from scratch. This is not a complete game, but includes complete portions of one - a main menu screen, working (not much playable content) game, and a level editor. This project features complex gui components created from scratch, such as buttons and text boxes.</description>

      <description>Description A complete, scalable clone of the popular web game, agar.io. This project was created purely in python, and utilizes the pygame (GUI) and sockets (web connection) libraries. There are 2 main files used to run code. The first is client.py, which runs the game itself. The second is server.py, which can be run on any network and can open a customizable &amp;ldquo;agar.io&amp;rdquo; server on any port. This game is playable online, and through local networks.</description>

      <description>Description This program is a demonstration of a genetic algorithm, with the use of &amp;ldquo;rockets&amp;rdquo; drawn as rectangles. Each &amp;ldquo;rocket&amp;rdquo; has its own dna telling them random directions to accelerate towards. Rockets effectively gain a higher (better) fitness the closer they are to the goal (green circle) and lose fitness (worse) if they try and go out of bounds or hit a boundary. In the scope of the genetic algorithm, these fitness scores are used to create the next &amp;ldquo;generation&amp;rdquo; of rocket which favors (not absolute) to combine dna of the top performing rockets.</description>

      <description>Description A map generating script primarly using the perlin noise equations. This program utilizes a the 2d perlin noise equation to generate topographic values in a 2d list. These values are normalized and assigned a &amp;ldquo;color output&amp;rdquo; depending on their value (for example, a low value would mean blue or water, while a high value might be grey for mountains). This program also uses poisson disc sampling to randomly generate trees across the landmasses.</description>
