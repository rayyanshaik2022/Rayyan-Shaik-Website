      <description>Description A multi-purpose discord bot to be used on a private server with my friends. This bot provides basic security for our server with an easily customizable verification system. Important e-learnig and virtual learning commands that can reply with my school&amp;rsquo;s schedule and per class zoom links. The bot can also join voice channels and play different sound effects stored as .mp3 files.

      <description>Description A showcase-esque project designed to demonstrate an improved understanding of sockets and client/network relationships. This was created in pure python with no game engines (such as Unity), everything from buttons, to servers, to the physics was created from scratch. This is not a complete game, but includes complete portions of one - a main menu screen, working (not much playable content) game, and a level editor. This project features complex gui components created from scratch, such as buttons and text boxes.</description>

      <description>Description A complete, scalable clone of the popular web game, agar.io. This project was created purely in python, and utilizes the pygame (GUI) and sockets (web connection) libraries. There are 2 main files used to run code. The first is client.py, which runs the game itself. The second is server.py, which can be run on any network and can open a customizable &amp;ldquo;agar.io&amp;rdquo; server on any port. This game is playable online, and through local networks.</description>

      <title>Smart Rockets</title>

      <guid>rayyanshaik.com/blog/smart-rockets/</guid>
      <description>Description This program is a demonstration of a genetic algorithm, with the use of &amp;ldquo;rockets&amp;rdquo; drawn as rectangles. Each &amp;ldquo;rocket&amp;rdquo; has its own dna telling them random directions to accelerate towards. Rockets effectively gain a higher (better) fitness the closer they are to the goal (green circle) and lose fitness (worse) if they try and go out of bounds or hit a boundary. In the scope of the genetic algorithm, these fitness scores are used to create the next &amp;ldquo;generation&amp;rdquo; of rocket which favors (not absolute) to combine dna of the top performing rockets.</description>

      <title>Perlin Noise Map Generator</title>

      <guid>rayyanshaik.com/blog/perlinmap/</guid>
      <description>Description A map generating script primarly using the perlin noise equations. This program utilizes a the 2d perlin noise equation to generate topographic values in a 2d list. These values are normalized and assigned a &amp;ldquo;color output&amp;rdquo; depending on their value (for example, a low value would mean blue or water, while a high value might be grey for mountains). This program also uses poisson disc sampling to randomly generate trees across the landmasses.</description>

      <title>Boids Flocking Algorithm</title>
      <link>rayyanshaik.com/blog/boids-flocking/</link>

      <guid>rayyanshaik.com/blog/boids-flocking/</guid>
      <description>Description My implementation of the boids flocking algorithm in pygame. It uses arrows - representative of birds - as enties that move around and account for each other&amp;rsquo;s positions. Some additional features that I implemented include an &amp;ldquo;infinite border&amp;rdquo; - meaning borders transport entities to opposite ends of the map. The entities also spawn with random hues (color), and when several enities converge into a group, their colors average out. When these groups disband, the entities slowly revert to their original color.</description>

      <guid>rayyanshaik.com/blog/astar-pathfinding/</guid>
      <description>Description An implementation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm. The logic behind this algorithm is based on the function f(n) = g(n) + h(n). Where the total cost of &amp;ldquo;moving&amp;rdquo; is the sum of the cost of the path to the starting node and the cost as calculated by the heuristic function for the cheapest path from the next node to the goal.
