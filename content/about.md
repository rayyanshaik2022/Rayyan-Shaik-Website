I am Rayyan Shaik, a rising junior studing Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Programming is something that I’m very passionate about, and a skill that I had began learning since middle school.

During my time at UPenn I've completed a variety of foundational computer science courses including `Data Structures & Algorithms`, `Computer Systems`, and `Software Design`.

Additionally, I've begun to branch out into specialized topics from `Applied Machine Learning` to `Cloud Computing & Scalability`. Over the next two years at Penn, I hope to further specialize in AI with an emphasis on reinforcement and deep learning.

I know have worked with a variety of languages, frameworks and ecosystems - that is to say I'm always ready to learn the best tool for a job.

On this website portfolio, you can find “posts” regarding my complete programming projects.
