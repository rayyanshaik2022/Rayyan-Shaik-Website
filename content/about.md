I am Rayyan Shaik, a 16 year old Junior at Windermere Preparatory School. Programming is something I'm very passionate about, and a skill that I had started learning during my years in middle school. Since then, I have completed AP Computer Science (score of 5 on AP Exam), a cybersecurity summer course at Embry Riddle (Through a National Security Agency scholarship), and I am also currently enrolled in IB Computer Science (Higher Level). I am also the vice president of my school's programming club, as well as the co-president and lead programmer for FRC (First Robotics Competition) Team 1649. 

I have been learning how to program in Python3 since 2017, and I have been learning how to program in Java since 2018. On this website portfolio, you can find "posts" regarding my complete programming projects.
