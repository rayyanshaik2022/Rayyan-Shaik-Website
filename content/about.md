I am Rayyan Shaik, a 19 year old sophomore studing Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Programming is something that I’m very passionate about, and a skill that I had began learning since middle school.

Since then, I have completed AP and IB Computer Science HL (scoring a 5, and 6 respectively), and a variety of computer science courses at UPenn, including Programming Fundamentals and Data Structures & Algorithms.

I have been learning how to program in Python3 since 2017, and began learning Java & Javascript in 2018. On this website portfolio, you can find “posts” regarding my complete programming projects.
